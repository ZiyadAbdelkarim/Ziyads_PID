This Is the PID code for 7899A for Pushback - will be realeased after May 4th when next game is announced or when season ends and we decide to use odometery or GPS. The code has comments on them - this will help you understand what it means. I reccomend watching  Connor 1814 for more. This was established under the creative commons lisence so dont violate it. Thank you and happy coding.
